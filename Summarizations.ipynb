      "Chapter III The fact was that up to the last moment he had never ex - pected such an ending; he had\n",
      "been overbearing to the last degree, never dreaming that two destitute and defence - less women\n",
      "could escape from his control. This conviction was strengthened by his vanity and conceit, a conceit\n",
      "to the point of fatuity. Pyotr Petrovitch, who had made his way up from insignificance, was morbidly\n",
      "given to self-admiration, had the highest opinion of his intelligence and capacities, and sometimes\n",
      "even gloated in solitude over his image in the glass. But what he loved and valued above all was the\n",
      "money he had amassed by his labour, and by all sorts of de - vices: that money made him the equal of\n",
      "all who had been his superiors. When he had bitterly reminded Dounia that he had de - cided to take\n",
      "her in spite of evil report, Pyotr Petrovitch had spoken with perfect sincerity and had, indeed,\n",
      "felt genuine - ly indignant at such ‘black ingratitude.’ And yet, when he made Dounia his offer, he\n",
      "was fully aware of the ground - lessness of all the gossip. The story had been everywhere\n",
      "contradicted by Marfa Petrovna, and was by then disbe - lieved by all the townspeople, who were warm\n",
      "in Dounia’a defence. And he would not have denied that he knew all that at the time. Yet he still\n",
      "thought highly of his own resolution in lifting Dounia to his level and regarded it as something \u0018\u0018\u0018\n",
      "heroic. In speaking of it to Dounia, he had let out the secret feeling he cherished and admired, and\n",
      "he could not under - stand that others should fail to admire it too. He had called on Raskolnikov\n",
      "with the feelings of a benefactor who is about to reap the fruits of his good deeds and to hear\n",
      "agree - able flattery. And as he went downstairs now, he considered himself most undeservedly\n",
      "injured and unrecognised. Dounia was simply essential to him; to do without her was unthinkable. For\n",
      "many years he had had voluptuous dreams of marriage, but he had gone on waiting and amass - ing\n",
      "money. He brooded with relish, in profound secret, over the image of a girl—virtuous, poor (she must\n",
      "be poor), very young, very pretty, of good birth and education, very timid, one who had suffered\n",
      "much, and was completely humbled before him, one who would all her life look on him as her saviour,\n",
      "worship him, admire him and only him. How many scenes, how many amorous episodes he had imag - ined\n",
      "on this seductive and playful theme, when his work was over! And, behold, the dream of so many years\n",
      "was all but realised; the beauty and education of Avdotya Ro - manovna had impressed him; her\n",
      "helpless position had been a great allurement; in her he had found even more than he dreamed of.\n",
      "Here was a girl of pride, character, virtue, of education and breeding superior to his own (he felt\n",
      "that), and this creature would be slavishly grateful all her life for his heroic condescension, and\n",
      "would humble herself in the dust before him, and he would have absolute, unbounded power over her! …\n",
      "Not long before, he had, too, after long reflection and hesitation, made an important change in his\n",
      "Crime and Punishment \u0018\u0018\u0018career and was now entering on a wider circle of business. With this change\n",
      "his cherished dreams of rising into a high - er class of society seemed likely to be realised…. He\n",
      "was, in fact, determined to try his fortune in Petersburg. He knew that women could do a very great\n",
      "deal. The fascination of a charming, virtuous, highly educated woman might make his way easier,\n",
      "might do wonders in attracting people to him, throwing an aureole round him, and now everything was\n",
      "in ruins! This sudden horrible rupture affected him like a clap of thunder; it was like a hideous\n",
      "joke, an absurdity. He had only been a tiny bit masterful, had not even time to speak out, had\n",
      "simply made a joke, been carried away —and it had ended so seriously. And, of course, too, he did\n",
      "love Dounia in his own way; he already possessed her in his dreams—and all at once! No! The next\n",
      "day, the very next day, it must all be set right, smoothed over, settled. Above all he must crush\n",
      "that conceited milksop who was the cause of it all. With a sick feeling he could not help recalling\n",
      "Ra - zumihin too, but, he soon reassured himself on that score; as though a fellow like that could\n",
      "be put on a level with him! The man he really dreaded in earnest was Svidrigaïlov…. He had, in\n",
      "short, a great deal to attend to…. ***** ‘No, I, I am more to blame than anyone!’ said Dounia,\n",
      "kissing and embracing her mother. ‘I was tempted by his money, but on my honour, brother, I had no\n",
      "idea he was such a base man. If I had seen through him before, nothing would have tempted me! Don’t\n",
      "blame me, brother!’ ‘God has delivered us! God has delivered us!’ Pulcheria \u0018\u0018\u0018 Alexandrovna\n",
      "muttered, but half consciously, as though scarcely able to realise what had happened. They were all\n",
      "relieved, and in five minutes they were laughing. Only now and then Dounia turned white and frowned,\n",
      "remembering what had passed. Pulcheria Alexan - drovna was surprised to find that she, too, was\n",
      "glad: she had only that morning thought rupture with Luzhin a terrible misfortune. Razumihin was\n",
      "delighted. He did not yet dare to express his joy fully, but he was in a fever of excitement as\n",
      "though a ton-weight had fallen off his heart. Now he had the right to devote his life to them, to\n",
      "serve them…. Anything might happen now! But he felt afraid to think of further possibilities and\n",
      "dared not let his imagination range. But Raskolnikov sat still in the same place, almost sullen and\n",
      "indifferent. Though he had been the most insistent on get - ting rid of Luzhin, he seemed now the\n",
      "least concerned at what had happened. Dounia could not help thinking that he was still angry with\n",
      "her, and Pulcheria Alexandrovna watched him timidly. ‘What did Svidrigaïlov say to you?’ said\n",
      "Dounia, ap - proaching him. ‘Yes, yes!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Raskolnikov raised his head.\n",
      "‘He wants to make you a present of ten thousand roubles and he desires to see you once in my\n",
      "presence.’ ‘See her! On no account!’ cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. ‘And how dare he offer her\n",
      "money!’ Then Raskolnikov repeated (rather dryly) his conversa - tion with Svidrigaïlov, omitting his\n",
      "account of the ghostly Crime and Punishment \u0018\u0018\u0018visitations of Marfa Petrovna, wishing to avoid all\n",
      "unneces - sary talk. ‘What answer did you give him?’ asked Dounia. ‘At first I said I would not take\n",
      "any message to you. Then he said that he would do his utmost to obtain an interview with you without\n",
      "my help. He assured me that his passion for you was a passing infatuation, now he has no feeling for\n",
      "you. He doesn’t want you to marry Luzhin…. His talk was altogether rather muddled.’ ‘How do you\n",
      "explain him to yourself, Rodya? How did he strike you?’ ‘I must confess I don’t quite understand\n",
      "him. He offers you ten thousand, and yet says he is not well off. He says he is going away, and in\n",
      "ten minutes he forgets he has said it. Then he says is he going to be married and has already fixed\n",
      "on the girl…. No doubt he has a motive, and probably a bad one. But it’s odd that he should be so\n",
      "clumsy about it if he had any designs against you…. Of course, I refused this money on your account,\n",
      "once for all. Altogether, I thought him very strange…. One might almost think he was mad. But I may\n",
      "be mistaken; that may only be the part he as - sumes. The death of Marfa Petrovna seems to have made\n",
      "a great impression on him.’ ‘God rest her soul,’ exclaimed Pulcheria Alexandrovna. ‘I shall always,\n",
      "always pray for her! Where should we be now, Dounia, without this three thousand! It’s as though it\n",
      "had fallen from heaven! Why, Rodya, this morning we had only three roubles in our pocket and Dounia\n",
      "and I were just planning to pawn her watch, so as to avoid borrowing from \u0018\u0018\u0018 that man until he\n",
      "offered help.’ Dounia seemed strangely impressed by Svidrigaïlov’s of - fer. She still stood\n",
      "meditating. ‘He has got some terrible plan,’ she said in a half whisper to herself, almost\n",
      "shuddering. Raskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror. ‘I fancy I shall have to see him more\n",
      "than once again,’ he said to Dounia. ‘We will watch him! I will track him out!’ cried Razumi - hin,\n",
      "vigorously. ‘I won’t lose sight of him. Rodya has given me leave. He said to me himself just now.\n",
      "‘Take care of my sister.’ Will you give me leave, too, Avdotya Romanovna?’ Dounia smiled and held\n",
      "out her hand, but the look of anxiety did not leave her face. Pulcheria Alexandrovna gazed at her\n",
      "timidly, but the three thousand roubles had obviously a soothing effect on her. A quarter of an hour\n",
      "later, they were all engaged in a lively conversation. Even Raskolnikov listened attentively for\n",
      "some time, though he did not talk. Razumihin was the speaker. ‘And why, why should you go away?’ he\n",
      "flowed on ecstati - cally. ‘And what are you to do in a little town? The great thing is, you are all\n",
      "here together and you need one an - other—you do need one another, believe me. For a time, anyway….\n",
      "Take me into partnership, and I assure you we’ll plan a capital enterprise. Listen! I’ll explain it\n",
      "all in detail to you, the whole project! It all flashed into my head this morning, before anything\n",
      "had happened … I tell you what; I have an uncle, I must introduce him to you (a most ac -Crime and\n",
      "Punishment \u0018\u00180commodating and respectable old man). This uncle has got a capital of a thousand\n",
      "roubles, and he lives on his pension and has no need of that money. For the last two years he has\n",
      "been bothering me to borrow it from him and pay him six per cent. interest. I know what that means;\n",
      "he simply wants to help me. Last year I had no need of it, but this year I re - solved to borrow it\n",
      "as soon as he arrived. Then you lend me another thousand of your three and we have enough for a\n",
      "start, so we’ll go into partnership, and what are we going to do?’ Then Razumihin began to unfold\n",
      "his project, and he explained at length that almost all our publishers and book - sellers know\n",
      "nothing at all of what they are selling, and for that reason they are usually bad publishers, and\n",
      "that any decent publications pay as a rule and give a profit, some - times a considerable one.\n",
      "Razumihin had, indeed, been dreaming of setting up as a publisher. For the last two years he had\n",
      "been working in publishers’ offices, and knew three European languages well, though he had told\n",
      "Raskolnikov six days before that he was ‘schwach’ in German with an object of persuading him to take\n",
      "half his translation and half the payment for it. He had told a lie then, and Raskol - nikov knew he\n",
      "was lying. ‘Why, why should we let our chance slip when we have one of the chief means of\n",
      "success—money of our own!’ cried Razumihin warmly. ‘Of course there will be a lot of work, but we\n",
      "will work, you, Avdotya Romanovna, I, Rodion…. You get a splendid profit on some books nowadays! And\n",
      "the great point of the business is that we shall know just what \u0018\u00181 wants translating, and we shall\n",
      "be translating, publishing, learning all at once. I can be of use because I have experi - ence. For\n",
      "nearly two years I’ve been scuttling about among the publishers, and now I know every detail of\n",
      "their busi - ness. You need not be a saint to make pots, believe me! And why, why should we let our\n",
      "chance slip! Why, I know—and I kept the secret—two or three books which one might get a hundred\n",
      "roubles simply for thinking of translating and publishing. Indeed, and I would not take five hundred\n",
      "for the very idea of one of them. And what do you think? If I were to tell a publisher, I dare say\n",
      "he’d hesitate—they are such blockheads! And as for the business side, printing, pa - per, selling,\n",
      "you trust to me, I know my way about. We’ll begin in a small way and go on to a large. In any case\n",
      "it will get us our living and we shall get back our capital.’ Dounia’s eyes shone. ‘I like what you\n",
