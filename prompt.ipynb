       "\n",
       "1. Key Areas of Focus:\n",
       "\n",
       "   - Data Structures: As a computer science student, a strong understanding of data structures is key. Spend a significant portion of your study time on this subject to improve your programming skills.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   - Databases: This is another crucial area for you, Huzaifa. Make sure to dedicate ample time understanding different database models and SQL queries.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   - Discrete Mathematics: This subject is often theoretical and abstract, which you've mentioned is a challenge area for you. Thus, we will focus on practical examples and visual aids to help you understand better.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Learning Strategies:\n",
       "\n",
       "   - Use diagrams and flowcharts extensively to understand and memorize concepts in Data Structures and Databases.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   - Watch educational videos on platforms like YouTube and Coursera to supplement your learning.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   - Use colored pens or highlighters to make your notes more visual and engaging.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Balancing Academics and Extracurricular Activities:\n",
       "\n",
       "   - Set a specific time for your Coding Club activities and strictly follow it. This will ensure you have a healthy balance between your academics and extracurricular activities.\n",

       "\n",
       "5. Structured Timeline:\n",
       "\n",
       "   - Divide your study time into 50-minute study sessions with 10-minute breaks in between. This technique is known as the Pomodoro Technique and has proven to be effective.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   - Allocate your weekdays to study and revise the concepts learned during the lectures. Use weekends to practice coding and work on assignments.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. Supplementary Resources:\n",
       "\n",
       "   - Use online platforms like Khan Academy and Coursera for video tutorials.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   - Join study groups to discuss and understand difficult concepts.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   - Utilize the academic support services provided by your institution.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. Motivational Tips:\n",
       "\n",
       "   - Set small, achievable goals for each study session.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   - Reward yourself after achieving each goal. This could be a short break, a snack, or anything that you enjoy.\n",
       "   \n",
       "   - Maintain a positive mindset and remember that it's okay to have unproductive days. What matters is your consistent effort.\n",
       "\n",
       "Remember, this plan is a guideline. Feel free to adjust it according to your needs and what works best for you. Happy Studying, Huzaifa!"
