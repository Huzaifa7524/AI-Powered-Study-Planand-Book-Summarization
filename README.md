## Overview

This project combines two powerful AI solutions: a personalized study plan prompt and a book summarization system. The personalized study plan prompt generates tailored study plans for students based on their unique needs, strengths, and aspirations. The summarization system, on the other hand, condenses lengthy books into comprehensive summaries, addressing the token limit constraint of GPT-4.

</p>

### Key Features

- **Hierarchical Summarization:** Utilizes a multi-level summarization approach to handle lengthy texts within the token limit.
- **ChatGPT and Groq Integration:** Employs ChatGPT for initial chapter summaries and Groq for final comprehensive summaries.
- **Text Segmentation:** Divides the book into smaller units for efficient processing and summary generation.
- **File Handling:** Saves individual chapter summaries and combines them to form a final summary for easy access.

### Usage

1. **Input:** Provide the lengthy book in a compatible format (e.g., PDF, plain text).
2. **Execution:** Run the provided Python script to initiate the summarization process.
3. **Output:** Access the final comprehensive summary generated by the system.

### Implementation Details

- **Chapter Summarization:** Utilizes ChatGPT to summarize each chapter individually.
- **Comprehensive Summary:** Employs Groq to generate a cohesive summary by combining the chapter summaries.
- **File Management:** Organizes summaries into separate files for easy retrieval and reference.

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Token Limit Constraint:** Mitigated by breaking down the book into smaller units and progressively summarizing them.
- **Coherence and Consistency:** Ensured through careful integration of chapter summaries into the final comprehensive summary.
- **API Rate Limits:** Handled by implementing rate limiting mechanisms and optimizing API usage.

### Next Steps

- Explore further optimization techniques to enhance the efficiency and quality of summarization.
- Incorporate user feedback mechanisms to refine and improve the summarization process.
- Extend support for additional document formats and integration with external storage services.
